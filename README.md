****Loan Repayment Prediction System**
This project is a machine learning web application that predicts 
whether a loan is likely to be paid back or not based on borrower information and loan details.
We have used a Random Forest Classifier as the main and best-performing model.

**Project Objectives**
Takes loan and borrower information as input
Uses a trained machine learning model to make a prediction
Shows whether the loan is likely to be paid back or not paid back
Returns a probability score to show confidence in the prediction
